2 things about electron:

    1. The "Main Process":
        - like a backend
        - where the actual resizing of the image happens
        - where we deal with the database

    2. The "Renderer Process":
        - like a frontend
        - basically the UI'

Bridging the "2 things about electron":

    electron has two main processes ("main" and "renderer")
     -> we can bridge these 2 processes using a "preload script".
